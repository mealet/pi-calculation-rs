### What is it? ðŸ‘€
This is a simple pi calculation program created out of boredom.<br>
It has its own settings file where you can change the accuracy, specify the number of numbers after
the decimal point, or enable the display of calculations (makes calculations take longer).

The formula I used: _[Leibniz formula for Ï€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)_
